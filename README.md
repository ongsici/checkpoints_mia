# Leveraing Checkpoints for Membership Inference Attacks

This repository contains the code, configurations, and analysis scripts for my Master's thesis:  
**"Leveraging Model Checkpoints to Improve Membership Inference Attacks in Large Language Models"**.

## üìú Overview
The project investigates how training checkpoints can be exploited to improve the effectiveness of membership inference attacks (MIAs) against large language models (LLMs). We evaluate across three model families ‚Äî **CroissantLLM**, **Pythia**, and **OLMo** ‚Äî and multiple datasets, including **Copyright Traps**, **The Pile**, **Dolma**, and **Paloma**.

We implement and evaluate:
- **Loss trace** and **EMA trace**-based MIAs
- **Attention-based RNN** classifiers
- **Cumulative Loss Fluctuation Average (CLFA)** from the SeqMIA paper
- **Distribution shift detection** (custom BoW + Blind MIA techniques)
