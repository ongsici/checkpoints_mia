## Data


This folder contains all the data that was used in experiments, and losses obtained from checkpoints. 
Due to the large file size, this has been saved separately on [OneDrive](https://imperiallondon-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/sco115_ic_ac_uk/EvLGD6RHBsFLo91TbeOKrMIBNEpT-4emQKPFVR6FXvAGUg?e=AeqMLd).
Note that Imperial College London email is required to access the folder.

All contents can be downloaded and placed directly into this folder to run other relevant python scripts / notebooks.
